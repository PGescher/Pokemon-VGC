Team Builder Policy:

Architecture:
    Encoding
    Embedding
    Transformer
    Selection Heads

Learning Process:
    Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning

    Samlping of Team

    Training Loop:
        Hyperparameters
        Reward Calculation

        Validation? How do we know if we overfit?


Possible Visualisation:

    Learning Process - Loss, LR, Elo, Winrate, Reward?

       Embeddings:
       Relationships.
       Decision.

    RoundRobin for Validation and display performance changes?
